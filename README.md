# Pets
Short description and motivation.

## Installation
1. Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pets'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

## Technical Debt
1. Path to node modules configurable to avoid `install node_modules` in sandbox project.
2. Try to not load every component in `window` object.
3. ~~webpack-dev-server is broken~~
